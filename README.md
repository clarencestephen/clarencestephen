## Hello World!!! ðŸ‘‹
I am a Data Scientist, a Founder, an AI enthusiast, a SQL/Python Developer, and a Mathlete. But first, I am a Father and a Husband. When I can, I am a Traveler, an Olympic Weightlifter, a Cinephile, a Guitar Player, a Scuba Diver, and a Surfer.

I come from a non-traditional background. My parents immigrated from Haiti, my spouse is from South Korea, and we both lived in Japan--I can speak 5 and 1/2 languages and even my children speak more than one. Uniquely, I started my career as an equity derivative trader before transitioning into Data Science. I offer an extremely unique perspective born from a wealth of diverse experiences across many industries and more than 40 countries.

I recently founded Readify, a generative AI startup focused on the literary space. Before Readify, I led client analytics at Morgan Stanley, and worked as a Data Scientist at Mars (consumer retail), and Button (mobile e-commerce start up).

Key Skills: Python, SQL, Generative AI, Clustering, Classification, A/B testing, Business Intelligence, NLP, Time Series Analysis, & Predictive Analytics
